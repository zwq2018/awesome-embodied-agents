A curated list of papers and resources on VLM/LLM-based embodied agents, focusing on memory, reasoning, planning, exploration, navigation, manipulation, and evaluation.

<!--
## Scope

This repository focuses on embodied AI systems where VLMs or MLLMs serve as agentic components: perceiving the environment, maintaining memory, reasoning over space and time, planning actions, interacting with tools or skills, and adapting through feedback.

Included:

- Embodied memory and embodied RAG
- VLM/MLLM-based embodied reasoning and planning
- Embodied exploration and navigation agents
- Embodied question answering
- Manipulation agents using VLMs as planners, skill selectors, or high-level controllers
- Benchmarks and evaluation resources for embodied agents

Usually out of scope:

- End-to-end VLA policies
- World models or video prediction models
- Low-level robot control
- Diffusion policies
- Generic LLM agents without embodied perception

Borderline works are included when the VLM/MLLM is used as an agentic decision-making, memory, reasoning, or planning module rather than only as a frozen encoder or direct action policy.
